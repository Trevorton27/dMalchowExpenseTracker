## Summary
This is my fourth application in the Mastermind Program and has helped me to push my boundaries once again. While similar to the to-do list, this incorporated building a table and multiple inputs of data simultaneously, which at first was a bit of a challenge. This was the first time I've utilized the .target method. Once I grasped the concept of this, I feel like its opened up ideas onto so many more possibilities with code.
